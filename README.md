# Hand-Tracking-Mouse-Control
This project allows users to control the mouse pointer and simulate clicks using hand gestures. The system uses a webcam to capture hand movements and the MediaPipe library to detect hand landmarks. The project integrates the OpenCV and autopy libraries to translate hand gestures into mouse actions.
